This Java project is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application that interacts with a SQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

## Features:
- **Login Interface**: Allows users to enter database connection details including server name, port number, database name, username, and password.
- **SQL Command Execution**: Provides a text area where users can input SQL commands to be executed against the connected database.
- **Results Display**: Shows the results of executed SQL commands in structured tables within a scrollable dialog for easy viewing.

## How to Use:
1. **Login**: Enter the required database connection details and click the "Login" button to establish a connection to the database.
2. **Execute SQL Commands**: Input SQL commands in the designated text area and click the "Execute SQL Commands" button to execute them.
3. **View Results**: Results of executed SQL commands will be displayed in tables within a scrollable dialog for better visualization.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface components.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: For connecting and interacting with the SQL database.
- **Java I/O**: For reading SQL files and displaying their contents.

## Dependencies:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- A SQL database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) with appropriate credentials.

## Setup:
1. Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
